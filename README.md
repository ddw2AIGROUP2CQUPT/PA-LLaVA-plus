# PA-LLaVA-plus
This is the first-stage weights trained on the 400w pathological image-text dataset using the PA-LLaVA model structure. The link is https://huggingface.co/OpenFace-CQUPT/PA-LLaVA-plus.

## 400w Dataset
The 400w pathology dataset is derived from the publicly available "Accessible Dataset (18M samples)" from MedTrinity-25M([UCSC-VLAA/MedTrinity-25M Â· Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA/MedTrinity-25M)). This is a dataset spanning multiple medical fields. By analyzing the linguistic structure of the text in this dataset, we extracted a 400w dataset specific to the pathology domain.
